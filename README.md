# 42-ft_container

In this project, we will be re-creating the following containers and their associated functions in `C++98`:

- [`Vector`](https://cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/) [`Stack`](https://cplusplus.com/reference/stack/stack/) [`Map`](https://cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/)

| Turn in files |                                     up to you : `*.cpp, *.hpp, *.tpp`                                     |
|   Libraries   | [STL](https://cplusplus.com/reference/stl/) is forbidden, however you are allowed to use the STD library. |

# Compilation

- `make` - compiles the program into `ft_container`
- `make clean` - removes the obj folder
- `make fclean` - clean and removes `ft_container`
- `make re` - fclean and recompiles
- `make test` - compiles and runs the test in the [`src`](src/) directory

To use the library classes in your code, simply include its' header:

```
#include "Vector.hpp"
#include "Stack.hpp"
#include "Map.hpp"
```
