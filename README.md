# 42-ft_container

In this project, we will be re-creating the following containers and their associated functions in C++:

- Vector
- Stack
- Map

# Compilation

- `make` - compiles the program into `ft_container`
- `make clean` - removes the obj folder
- `make fclean` - clean and removes `ft_container`
- `make re` - fclean and recompiles
- `make test` - compiles and runs the test in [`main.cpp`](main.cpp)

To use the library classes in your code, simply include its' header:

```
#include "Vector.hpp"
#include "Stack.hpp"
#include "Map.hpp"
```
